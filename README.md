Hi,
here, after a while, I send you the expamle.

Sender and Client are c# apps and SignalR-Demo/Project1 is the Delphi Client.

Please start the Sender app.
You will see a button.
This button is sending two messages. 

Now start the Project1.exe (Delphi-Project).

Click the button.

You will see that the first message is received well but the seconde message will incomplete.

The Client-App (c#) will receive both messages in the same form.
